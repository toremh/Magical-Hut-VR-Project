# VR Project

This is a project built by me (Trevor Heinemann) in Unity on top of code created by Prasanth Sasikumar for the University of Auckland. The Escape room is themed around being trapped in a witch's hut where you must find and insert the components of a "spell" which frees you and ends the game.
